# Income Groups Prediction Model on a Data from a Survey on Income and Expenditure.
* Designed a predictive model to determine the income groups of the respondents based on their personal data.
* Developed comprehensive & in-depth descriptive analytics and insight on the relationship between the income groups and other categorical and numerical attributes.
* Performed data cleaning, feature engineering to prepare it for classification machine learning application.
* ML algorithms such as LogReg, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM are applied to choose the best prediction model.
* Build predictsalary() function where the input arguments are the model object & test data for collaboration purpose.
